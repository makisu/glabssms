# Globe Labs SMS Ruby Library
[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/makisu/glabssms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/makisu/glabssms)

Send SMS using [Globe Labs](http://www.globelabs.com.ph/developer/api) in Ruby.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'glabssms'
```

Or install it yourself as:

```ruby
gem install glabssms
```

## Usage

In an initializer:

```ruby
Glabssms.configure do |c|
  c.app_id = 'GLABS_APP_ID'
  c.app_secret = 'GLABS_APP_SECRET'
  c.cross_telco_short_code = 'GLABS_CROSS_TELCO_SHORT_CODE'
  c.short_code = 'GLABS_SHORT_CODE'
end
```

## Initializing a Client

This is the instance that you will be interacting with to send SMS.

```ruby
# This client grabs defaults from config
client = Glabssms::Client.new(Glabssms::Configuration.new)

# Only to override the defaults that were set in config
client = Glabssms::Client.new(
  app_id: "...",
  app_secret: "...",
  cross_telco_short_code: "...",
  short_code: "..."
)
```

## Fetching Access Token after Subscriber Opt-In

You need to have the user go through the Subscriber Consent Workflow. They can
either [Opt-In via
SMS](http://www.globelabs.com.ph/docs/#getting-started-opt-in-via-sms) or
[Opt-In via
Webform](http://www.globelabs.com.ph/docs/#getting-started-opt-in-via-webform).
Globe Labs will then post the `code` to your Redirect URL. You can then use the
`code` you receive below.

```ruby
result = client.get_token(
  code: code_from_opt_in
)

# result will be an instance of TokenResult
result.success?
=> true
token_from_subscriber_opt_in = result.access_token
subscriber_number = result.subscriber_number
```

## Sending SMS

```ruby
result = client.send_sms(
  number: subscriber_number, # Can be in the form +639171234567 or 09171234567 or 9171234567
  message: 'max_160_character_string',
  token: token_from_subscriber_opt_in
)

result.success?
=> true
result.message
=> 'max_160_character_string'
result.number
=> '9171234567'
result.sender_address
=> '0000'
```

## Running the test suite

1. Install the latest Ruby

2. Copy `config.yml.sample` to `config.yml` then run:
```
bundle exec rspec spec
```

3. You can replace values in `config.yml` with values from your Globe Labs API
   dashboard

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
